During the [ICE/IEEE ITMC conference](http://www.ice-conference.org "ice-conference") 2018 that was held on Stuttgart, Germany  from the 17th-20th June, I presented a paper "Modelling, Printing and Validation of Dental Dry Models for Implantology Skills Training". This was a project we had with a Master student, about how to fabricate, using Additive Manufaturing, a "jaw" to be used as a pedagogical support for dental implantology training.

The paper is alraedy online at the IEEE Xplore repository take a look: [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8436302/)
