This post presents a test for a 3D model visualisation using [p3d.in](https://p3d.in) iframe. The example used the [Agisoft PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/) doll example data frame.

We have been recently testing some digitalization technologies for **museum and cultural heritage** objects using either digital scanners like the [ArtecEva](https://www.artec3d.com/portable-3d-scanners/artec-eva "Artec") or photogrammetry technologies like the [Agisoft](http://www.agisoft.com/) software. Once the digital object acquired we have been experimenting on what to do next with?

Some test has led us to use additive manufacturing and 3D printers to reproduce a copy of the object like for example an Apollon head copy using SLS (more on that on another post), but also the idea to make available the object online as a way to continue the museum visit. 

As you can see the interest is that you can somehow manipulate (turn around, and look closer ) the object than what you will be normally allowed with the real object. 

When this is co-created with the museum professionals you can help visitors to get into precise details explanations that are not possible with the original object.
